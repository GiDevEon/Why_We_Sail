        <h2>Decision Making:</h2>
        <p>
          Sailing teaches and gets people comfortable with making real time
          decisions. When faced with the changing courses of other boats and
          wind shifts, the sailor need to constantly make decisions to safely
          maneuver the boat, and to do so without time to discuss or
          contemplate. This is one reason the U.S. Navy uses sailing as a
          teaching tool to high school age NJROTC cadets and to Midshipmen at
          the Naval Academy.

        <h2>Self-Confidence:</h2>
        <p>
          There is simply nothing like being able to pilot your own craft at the
          age of 9 years old. Riding a bike is one thing. Skillfully steering
          and docking a sailboat is quite another.

        <h2>Team Work:</h2>
        <p>
          An analogy is to imagine have people to drive your car, one person on
          the wheel, one person for the accelerator, and one person for the
          brake. To not properly work as a team on a sailboat will cause chaotic
          sail and boat behavior often causing the boat to turn out of control,
          or for a small sailboat to tip. That's a lot of motivation to learn to
          work as a team.

        <h2>Communication Skills:</h2>
        <p>
          Sailing demands accurate and clear and timely communication between
          every member of the crew. To not properly communicate can quickly
          cause things to go wrong, such as falling behind on a race, or tipping
          the boat.

        <h2>Adventurous:</h2>
        <p>
          Sailing creates a sense of adventure which combines curiosity and
          boldness and becoming comfortable to face new challenges. It does so
          while being fun creating the desire to enjoy new challenges.

        <h2>Risk Taking:</h2>
        <p>
          Sailors who race learn to take risks and become comfortable with
          taking risks. They also quickly learn the results of taking too much
          risk. Many young sailors will tip their boat on a warm summer day just
          for the fun of pushing the risk taking beyond the limit. Learning
          small boat sailing on a warm summer day in calm waters is where
          disastrous results of going beyond the limit can be fun.

        <h2>Responsibility:</h2>
        <p>
          Taking command of even a small boat is a lot of responsibility. Not
          only are boats costly to purchase and repair, but being in any
          situation involving water has a certain level of danger. Even the
          youngest sailor learns the need to follow safety protocols, safe
          practices, using safety gear, and acting in a safe manner. Sailing is
          so much fun, all sailors are motivated to learn and follow the
          practices of safe and proper seamanship in order to keep sailing.

        <h2>Courage:</h2>
        <p>
          To step away from the land into the marine environment powered only by
          the wind takes courage. To try to make a boat sail as fast as it can
          and to take risks in order to be victorious during a race, takes
          courage. Sailors who are comfortable while sailing, especially in a
          racing situation have developed a deep rooted level of courage.

        <h2>Shipshape Habits:</h2>
        <p>
          Sailing students learn how to properly rig and unrig a boat. Kids
          learn to put things away in the right place, and keep them tidy while
          on the water, especially small boat sailing. It’s not that sailors are
          “neat freaks” it’s just that it creates a safer environment and is
          practical due to the rocking and heeling of the boat. That’s a skill
          no mom or dad can argue with.

        <h2>Perseverance:</h2>
        <p>
          Sailing rewards perseverance. There is a good reason why many boats
          have been named Tenacity, Resolute, and Endurance. Success in sailing
          is often due to having steadfastness of doing something despite
          difficulty or delay in achieving the object.

          A sailor must not be rigid in following a plan because the sea and
          weather are always changing. The sailor must learn a level of
          flexibility to be successful.

        <h2>Cognitive Skills</h2>
        <p>
          To communicate with a crew, manage the shape and trim of a sail, steer
          the boat, navigate the boat in the bay considering other boats,
          shoals, etc.; to do this in a changing environment with wind shifts,
          and tidal currents; to learn using every sense the human has while
          instantaneous problem solving; and to do so with the ease and comfort
          as taking a breath of the sea air. There is no better tool for
          teaching cognitive skills.

          Velocity, bearing between boats, tracking distances, the real world

          realize that they are learning mathematics such as geometry, as well
          as basic physics.

        <h2>Leadership:</h2>
        <p>
          The sailboat is a floating leadership laboratory. Every sailor will
          have time as skipper, and will need to take command and navigate and
          safely steer his boat among changing, often challenging conditions.
          Every sailor will have time working with a skipper, learning the
          adage, before you lead, you need to learn to follow. The U.S. Navy
          sends its top high school NJROTC cadets to the Leadership and Sailing
          Academy so in a short two week period they can learn the leadership
          skills needed to return to take over command positions in their units.
          The Naval Academy will have its newest midshipmen have a similar
          experience during their first eight weeks of arrival because the
          sailboat is a very effective tool for teaching leadership.
