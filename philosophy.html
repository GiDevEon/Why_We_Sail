        <h2>Subtle qualities</h2>
        <p>
          "The sheet winches creak, the water murmurs on the bottom as
          <em>Joshua</em> gathers way and begins to come alive... People who do
          not know that a sailboat is a living creature will never understand
          anything about boats and the sea.<br />
          The wake stretches on and on, white and dense with life by day,
          luminous by night. Like long tresses of dreams and stars. Water runs
          along the hull and rumbles or sings or rustles, depending on the wind,
          depending on the sky, depending on wether the sund was setting red or
          grey. For many days it has been red, and the wind hums in the rigging,
          makes a halyard tap against the mast at times, passes over the sails
          like caress and goes on its way to the west, toward Madeira, as
          <em>Joshua</em> rushes to the south in the trade wind at 7 knots.
          <br />
          Wind, sea, boat and sails, a compact, diffuse whole, without beginning
          or end, a part and all of the universe... my own universe, truly
          mine.<br />
          I watch the sun set and inhale the breath of the open sea, I feel my
          being blossoming and my joy soars so high that nothing can disturb it.
          The other questions, the ones that used to bother me at times, do not
          weigh anything before the immensity of a wake so close to the sky and
          filled with the wind of the sea."

        <h2>The Seagull and the old ship</h2>
        <p>
          "The weather is fine; The wake runs off behind me with a slight
          ripple. Sitting in the cockpit, I watch the sea and listen to the
          music of the water thrown by the stern. And I see a little seagull
          descend on my knee. I don't dare move, not even breathe, for fear that
          it might fly away and not return. It is completely white, almost
          translucent, with very large, black eyes and a finely cut beak. I
          hadn't seen it fly up, hadn't felt its wing flapping faster as it
          settled down. My body is naked in the sun, and yet I don't feel it on
          the skin of my knee. It weighs next to nothing. My hand approaches her
          slowly. She looks at me while cleaning her plumage. I'm getting closer
          She stops cleaning herself and looks at me without fear. And her eyes
          seem to be talking to me. My hand approaches her a little more gently
          to caress her back. Now she speaks to me, and at that moment I
          understand that it is by no means a miracle, but a perfectly natural
          thing. And she tells me the story of the beautiful sailing ship,
          manned by human beings. With millions of human beings. On departure
          they spoke of a long research trip. People wanted to know where they
          came from, where they were going. But over time they completely forgot
          why they were actually on the ship. Then, and I begin, very, very
          gradually, they got fat and became demanding passengers who were no
          longer interested in the life of the sea and the ship. What interested
          her was only her small, personal comfort. They have submitted to
          becoming mediocre, and when they say "That's life" they are professing
          resignation and lack of resistance. Even the captain has resigned for
          fear of upsetting his passengers if he turned to avoid the unknown
          reefs, the threat of which he senses in the depth of his instinct. The
          visibility gets worse, the wind increases, and the beautiful sailing
          ship sails on the same course. The captain hopes a miracle will occur
          that will soothe the sea and allow him to turn without bothering
          anyone. The sun has risen to midday. She crossed the meridian without
          my moving. Now my seagull is sleeping on my knee. I've known her for a
          long time. It is the white seagull that lives on all islands where the
          sun is the god of men. She flies out to sea in the morning and always
          returns to her island in the evening. So it is enough to follow it."

        <h2>Embrace the suck</h2>
        <p>
          "Energy-sapping storms, dangerously high waves, gloomy clouds that
          scurry over the water and carry all the sadness, all the despondency
          of the world. Still, you keep going, perhaps because you know you have
          to keep going, even if you don't understand why. Bright skies and
          blood-red sunsets over a lake that sparkles with power and light and
          gives you all its strength, its whole truth. Then you know why you are
          going on, why you want to go to the end and go further. Rushing of the
          water Rushing of the water. The rush of water Once upon a time the
          alchemist worked on matter for a long, long, long time. A very, very,
          very long time. And people believed that he was out to create the
          miracle stone that would turn all things into gold. What the alchemist
          was really looking for was not the miracle stone that turns all things
          into gold. It was just the transformation of the alchemist himself,
          through time, patience, and more time. And sometimes the alchemist
          went too far. But in the high latitudes, people who are crushed by
          their smallness are at the same time supported and protected by the
          feeling of their size. Right there, in the infinite ode of the
          southern ocean, I clearly feel how much man is atom and god at the
          same time. And when I go on deck at dawn, it can happen that I want to
          scream out my joie de vivre at the sight of the sky that lights up
          over the long, foam-crowned waves of this gigantic sea, an expression
          of power and beauty that sometimes tries to murder. With my whole
          being I live what is called living. And looking at the sea, it may be
          inevitable to go further."
