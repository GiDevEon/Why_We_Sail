					<h2>Philosophy:</h2>
					<p>
						The sheet winches creak, the water murmurs on the bottom as <em>Joshua</em> gathers way and begins to come alive... People who do not know that a sailboat is a living creature will never understand anything about boats and the sea.<br>The wake stretches on and on, white and dense with life by day, luminous by night. Like long tresses of dreams and stars. Read on with <a href="philosophy.html"><em>Philosophy</em>.</a>

					<h2>Lifestyle:</h2>
					<p>
						As you buy a Sailboat, you buy the World, and she lays at your fingertips.<br>Once you’re settled, life will carry on roughly the same as it always has. You’ll watch the same TV programs, enjoy the same or similar activities, shop at the same stores and after you make a new social circle you’ll have the same circle of friends. You physically move but your life remains very similar to the way it was in the past. Today I’m here to let you know that choosing to live the sailing lifestyle is not like a new job and it’s nothing like moving house or town.

By learning through self-discovery, people develop a thirst for greater learning as well as a deeper understanding of the subject.

					<h2>Healing: Love, desire and passion</h2>
					<p>
						What really sets sailing apart cannot be told in data and facts. It frees hearts, for example. It purifies the soul. It always goes hand in hand with noble values ​​and deep feelings. A prominent team of authors describes this phenomenon in a collage of texts.
