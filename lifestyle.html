        <h2>Drinking champagne and talking about the peasants:</h2>
        <p>
          Days are spent executing a passage, enjoying a jaw-droppingly
          beautiful anchorage with white sandy beaches lined with palm trees or
          heading out for a div class="article_containere, or hike up a volcano
          with newfound friends from the anchorage. But it's not alway sunshine
          and rainbows like Brady Trautman(SV Delos) once ironically said while
          repairing something again in the midst of the ocean: "Yachting:
          Drinking champagne and talking about the peasants".

        <h2>Bliss:</h2>
        <p>
          Mornings are blissfully rewarding while watching the quiet glow of
          dawn sneaking up onto the horizon. Evenings are spent celebrating a
          wonderful day lived as the sunset bursts into life with yellows,
          oranges, and pinks one last time before saying good night. Your new
          and old cruiser friends will talk about good anchorages, where to find
          the best bakery, and what’s the solution to your latest boat issue.
          You’ll arrange sundowners on the beach with a few boats and decide
          who’s bringing the salsa and who’s bringing the chips. On the beach,
          the small group will enjoy light conversation and at some point,
          someone will say: Hey – aren’t we the luckiest people around? How
          could life get any better than this? You will all look at each other,
          your heart fills with gratitude and you’ll almost feel anxious or even
          scared that this feeling won’t happen again. You then remind yourself,
          ‘Don’t feel anxious…this happens every other night. It happened
          tonight and this amazing feeling will happen again very soon.’

        <h2>What are the upsides / best things about living on a sailboat?</h2>
        <p>
          The simplicity and freedom.Living in a sailboat is a bit like
          glamping. You are forced to get outside no matter what the weather,
          meaning you don’t miss those stunning sunsets, rainbows or dramatic
          thunderstorms. Even more than that, the weather determines your
          decisions. When you’re living in a sailboat you learn to read the
          weather and feel it in a way I never did when I lived in a house.
          Also, you have to be careful with how much water and electricity
          you’re using, which has taught me so much about the environment and
          how little I need all those things I had come to rely on when living
          in a house. Then there is the freedom. If you don’t like where you
          are, you just take your home and move it elsewhere. Plus, the feeling
          you get when you sail into the ocean and the signal dies on your phone
          is pretty great — it’s just you and miles of sea, and all the
          pressures of life just wash away.
