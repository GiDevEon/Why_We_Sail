        <h2>Sailing via sick certificate</h2>
        <p>
          It is said that sailing is balm for the soul. Escape from everyday
          life. In this context, "cast off" is also a household word, even among
          landlubbers. It stands for starting anew, setting yourself free,
          thinking differently - even if only for a short time -, points of view
          rethink, rearrange, the familiar, the everyday environment moves
          eighth, gets smaller until nothing can be seen behind the horizon,
          regardless of whether the trip lasts a few hours, an afternoon or many
          days and weeks. No matter whether on inland or high seas, dinghy or
          big ship, whether sporty or leisurely. The effect may be different,
          but in principle the same. Only recently was even the ordinary
          judiciary concerned with the question of whether it is with This
          salutary effect of sailing has something to do with it. Essentially,
          it was about whether a medically certified burn-out disease can be
          successfully treated while sailing. An employee was ill for two and a
          half months and was given sick leave and then went to Croatia to sail.
          The termination without notice followed. The judges found it wrong
          after the attending physician testified that she had expressly advised
          her patient. The Düsseldorf State Labor Court followed the argument of
          the doctor - in the deep inland. So it is on record: sailing is balm
          for the soul. But are things really that simple? Then, when in doubt,
          the stressed city dweller only needed to sit on a boat and get some
          fresh air. In the end, the health insurance company would have to pay
          for antifouling or take on charter costs. And why hasn't the entire
          stress-ridden nation been sailing long ago - actually irresponsible
          not to do so. Perhaps there are limits to this fountain of youth after
          all. How far has it come with the healing effects of sailing, who does
          it affect, and what needs to be done to ensure that the time on board
          remains a lasting experience?

          ”So on the one hand there are very typical time-out experiences and on
          the other hand there are very different individual experiences.
          Similar to the motives for starting out. Burn-out or midlife crises
          are not always the case the mainspring for a conscious retreat on
          board. And age does not seem to play a role in the desire to retreat
          to the water. Admittedly, the 73-year-old Swede Sven Yrvind is an
          extreme example. He is preparing himself for these days the non-stop
          circumnavigation of the world on a boat ten feet long. That's 3.10
          meters. Needless to say, he'll sit alone in that bathtub. Yrvind is
          not an aging weirdo. He has crossed oceans several times Taken behind
          him without accidents in self-designed and built sailing canoes, he
          has held the record for circumnavigating Cape Horn in the smallest
          boat since 1980.

          What everyone unites is a certain regularity in what they do. And
          according to Dr. Ewald Piel is also important when it comes to
          creating an effective balance from everyday life. Piel is not alone in
          his opinion. The educator Kerstin Möller has also discovered sailing
          as a suitable medium for her health education courses. On the
          flat-bottomed ship “Anna Lisa” she offers a “Sailing weekend for
          health maintenance” under the title “Resource Travel”. Möller works
          primarily with the environment. From Glückstadt it goes off the Elbe,
          including dry traps. "The mudflats as living space offer the ideal
          environment for my purposes," she says. "People are constrained by the
          constraints of their professional life. I confront them with the
          vastness of the Wadden Sea and observe how they deal with it." She has
          worked in art therapy for a long time. It is important to her to
          depict problems. In the mud flats it is the case that the course
          participants mark out rooms, the size corresponds to what they
          perceive to be free space. Then they should mark out how big The
          maritime environment on board also offers a lot of metaphors. “A
          passing container ship only comes towards you, looks threatening, but
          disappears astern, becomes smaller and smaller and soon won't be seen
          anymore. ”Möller speaks in a calm voice, but when she talks about this
          cornucopia of pictures, she sounds enthusiastic. Knots would be
          untied, new shores discovered, a breath of fresh air let into one's
          own world of thought.
